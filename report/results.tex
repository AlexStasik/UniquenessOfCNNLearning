\section{Results}

The cifar10 dataset was split into two halves that were found to give roughly equal classification accuracy on a single network trained to classify all 10 classes. However, when the data set was split up it turned out that one was somewhat easier than the other.  

\subsection{Cifar5 transfer learning}

After having trained a network on each of the datasets, freezing the first layer and transfer learning on the opposite dataset showed that the performance going one way was
